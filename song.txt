Morning After
Dead by Sunrise

Caught up against the wall again
Tied and chained to the ball again
Never seems to amaze my mind
So I just sleep (sleep) sleep (sleep) sleep
Please don't
Wake me 'til the morning after
Wake me 'til the morning after
Cut and bruised by the fall again
Lick my wounds like a dog again
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel
That I see (see) I see (see)
Please let it be but don't
Wake me 'til the morning after
Wake me 'til the morning after
Wake me 'til the morning after
I'm so tired
There has got to be an end
To the pain I feel when I'm awake and alive alive alive
Alive and I'm dreamin'
Caught up against the wall again
Tied and chained to the ball again
Never seems to amaze my mind
So I just sleep (sleep)
Sleep (sleep)
Sleep
Please don't
Wake me till the morning after
Wake me till the morning after
Wake me till the morning after
I'm so tired there has got to be an end
To the pain I feel
When I'm awake and alive alive alive
Alive and I'm dreamin'
